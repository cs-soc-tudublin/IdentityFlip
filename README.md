# CS++ IdentityFlip

IdentityFlip is CS++'s Universal Styles for web-based systems.

It is based very closely on Redbrick's [Design System](https://github.com/redbrick/design-system)

IdentityFlip aims to provide a universal Identity Kit for CS++, including fonts, graphics and assets, and themes.
IdentityFlip contains approved styles, fonts, and graphics used to represent the society, and an amendment here will impact any CS++ project using IdentityFlip.
